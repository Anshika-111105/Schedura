# Optimization of Scheduling Problems using Graph Coloring Algorithms

![Image](src/components/Image6.png)

## 📌 Introduction
Scheduling problems are prevalent in various domains such as examination timetabling, task scheduling in operating systems, and resource allocation. To optimize such problems efficiently, **Graph Coloring Algorithms** provide an effective solution by minimizing conflicts and ensuring optimal resource utilization.

This project aims to implement graph coloring algorithms to optimize scheduling problems, focusing on techniques like:
- **Greedy Algorithm**
- **Welsh-Powell Algorithm**
- **DSATUR Algorithm**

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
The goal is to minimize conflicts in scheduling scenarios where resources such as time slots, classrooms, or processors must be allocated efficiently. The project addresses:
- Conflict-free scheduling
- Minimization of resource usage
- Enhanced efficiency through algorithm optimization

---

## 📈 Algorithms Implemented
### 1. **Greedy Algorithm**
- Assigns colors (resources) sequentially to nodes (tasks/events) with minimal conditions.
- Time Complexity: `O(V + E)`

### 2. **Welsh-Powell Algorithm**
- A more efficient method that sorts nodes by degrees before coloring.
- Time Complexity: `O(VlogV)`

### 3. **DSATUR Algorithm**
- Dynamically selects the vertex with the highest saturation degree for coloring.
- Time Complexity: `O(V^2)`
